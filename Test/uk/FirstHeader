${Opt StartPage }

${#} Reset the page totals of units:
${Calc PageTotal := 0 }
${Calc PageTotalLastPage := 0 }

${#} This (non printing) line is used in generating an index, keep it to at most 50 characters

${#} The line below is a hack to prevent the PO: line from counting to the total # lines on the page:
${Calc PageLineNo := 0 }
${Calc v42 := 42 }
